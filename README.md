### README for Pre-commit Hooks in Django Project

This README provides instructions for setting up and using pre-commit hooks in your Django project. These configurations include various tools such as `flake8`, `reorder-python-imports`, `setup-cfg-fmt`, `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `bandit`, `prettier`, and `shellcheck` to enhance code quality and security.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that the following tools are installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip
- Node.js (for prettier)
- shellcheck

### Installing pre-commit

First, install the pre-commit tool:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

### Configuring pre-commit

Create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
        name: flake8
        entry: flake8
        language: system
        types: [python]

      - id: reorder-python-imports
        name: reorder-python-imports
        entry: reorder-python-imports
        language: system
        types: [python]

      - id: setup-cfg-fmt
        name: setup-cfg-fmt
        entry: setup-cfg-fmt
        language: system
        types: [python]

      - id: mypy
        name: mypy
        entry: mypy
        language: system
        types: [python]

      - id: black
        name: black
        entry: black
        language: system
        types: [python]

      - id: isort
        name: isort
        entry: isort
        language: system
        types: [python]

      - id: bandit
        name: bandit
        entry: bandit
        language: system
        types: [python]

      - id: prettier
        name: prettier
        entry: prettier --write
        language: system
        types: [javascript, json, css, html, yaml]

      - id: shellcheck
        name: shellcheck
        entry: shellcheck
        language: system
        types: [shell]
        files: \.sh$
```

### Installing Local Tools

Install the required local tools:
```bash
pip install flake8 reorder-python-imports setup-cfg-fmt mypy black isort bandit
npm install --global prettier
sudo apt-get install shellcheck
```

### Installing pre-commit hooks

After configuring the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, install the hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Using pre-commit hooks

Each time you add changes to the repository and commit, the pre-commit hooks will automatically run. If any hook detects issues, the commit will be halted, and you'll need to fix the issues before committing again.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Skipping pre-commit hooks

If you need to commit or push without running pre-commit hooks, use the `--no-verify` option:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
git push --no-verify origin your-branch-name
```

### Updating pre-commit hooks

To update the pre-commit hooks to the latest versions, use the following command:
```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

### Conclusion

### Skipping a Specific Hook

To skip the execution of a particular hook, such as `flake8`, you can include the `SKIP` option in your commit command:

```bash
SKIP=flake8 git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

This command tells Git to skip the `flake8` hook specifically for the current commit.

### Running Pre-commit Hooks with Skip Option

Alternatively, you can run all pre-commit hooks while skipping a specific one using the following command:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files --skip flake8
```

This command executes all hooks configured in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file but skips the `flake8` hook.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how you might use these commands in practice:

1. **Committing with Skip Option**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   SKIP=flake8 git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

2. **Running Pre-commit Hooks with Skip**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files --skip flake8
   ```

By including these options, you can selectively bypass specific pre-commit hooks temporarily, ensuring flexibility in your development workflow. Include this information in your README to guide other contributors on how to manage hooks effectively during commits.
